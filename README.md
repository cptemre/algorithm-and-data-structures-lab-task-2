# ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURES LABORATORY

## TASK 2

### GENERAL INFORMATION

1. This project has been prepared for a course in informatics in the first semester.

2. Project is prepared in Visual Studio 2022 application in Windows 11 OS. It may not work as intended in other platforms.

3. Project only contains the code in github not the project folder prepared by Visual Studio.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Factorial (n!) Is the product of n consecutive natural numbers, whereby additionally 0! = 1.
Calculating the factorial is a prime example of using recursion:
n! = n * (n-1)!
Example:
5! = 5 * 4! = 5 * 4 * 3! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 0! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 120
